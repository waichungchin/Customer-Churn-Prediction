My capstone project, "Analysing the Factors Affecting Customer Churn and Predicting Customer Churn for a Telecommunication Industry," allowed me to apply advanced data mining and machine learning methods to 
improve churn prediction for a major telecom company. By analyzing a dataset of over 3,000 customers, I successfully identified patterns and quantified churn risk factors, demonstrating my proficiency in 
data-driven decision-making.
